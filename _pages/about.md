Hi there! I am Pengcheng Wang, currently a first-year MSCS student at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, supervised by Dr. Tong Zhang. Before UIUC, I completed my Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Engineering with a Minor in AI Engineering at the University of Toronto. During my undergraduate studies, I was fortunate to be guided by Dr. Alistair Johnson in healthcare AI research. My current research interests center on Generative Models, with a particular focus on Large Language Models, Reinforcement Learning (Post-Training), Multimodality, and their application in Healthcare.
